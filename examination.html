    <h1> 10 Most Visited Countries in the World:</h1>

    <img id="img1" src="1.jpg" alt="France">
    <p>Patched up with idyllic villages and romantic cities, France wears its culture in both iconic landmarks and ordinary settings. Few have the audacity to gild everything in gold, but the country's noble castles, villas and cathedrals pull off ostentatious decor with a nonchalance attributed to its long centuries of royal history.</p>
    <p>As if to match, the village-square markets, cafe terraces, and the daily rituals of a coffee and croissant presents a genteel sort of luxury. Don't overlook its outdoors either; the lyrical forests of Corsica and the warm waters of the French Riviera are well-sought retreats for city-dwellers.</p>
    <p>Attractions: Eiffel Tower, Palace of Versailles, French Riviera, Chamonix, Mont St-Michel, Paris Bridges.</p>
    <h2>2. Spain: 84 Million Visitors:</h2>
    <p>Passion flares in Spain, a country crafted for the good life. Maybe that's why Spain wins the 2nd place for the most visited countries in the world. </p>
    <img id="img2" src="2.jpg" alt="Spain">
    <p>Embark on an epic road trip looping from Barcelona to Madrid - glimpses of Spain's enduring landscapes pass by like a photographer's reel. Gather around the Gothic quarters of Barcelona and browse the experimental works of Gaudi before taking off for the mysterious Alhambra in Granada, or the flamenco halls of Seville.</p>
    <p>There is also Bilbao and San Sebastian in the north, ready to satiate your hunger with delicious pinxtos and avant-garde architecture.</p>
    <p>For nature that transforms every season, visit the hills of Picos de Europa and snow-capped Sierra Nevada, the sandy reaches of Menorca. From coast to mountains and dry in-land outposts you'll sense that for all the history lurking in the corners, Spain lives in the moment.</p>
    <p>Attractions: La Familia Sagrada, Park Guell, The Alhambra, El Retiro, Guggenheim Museum, Real Alcazar, Mallorca's beaches.</p>
    <h2>3. United States: 79 Million Visitors:</h2>
    <p>America has always been a popular travel destination due to its sprawl of metropolis and small town charms; last year, it welcomed a rounded-down number of 82 million visitors. With travel patterns trending towards city hopping and road tripping, America's endless highways are a siren's call.</p>
    <img id="img3" src="3.jpg" alt="USA">
    <p>New York City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, and Boston are all cities of transience, ever-evolving urban spaces that broils over with mixed cultures and cuisines.</p>
    <p>There is then musical Austin and free-spirited Portland, a San Francisco as dynamic as its coastal waves, and Miami which entertains with beaches and nightlife.</p>
    <p>There is also the quiet heat of the Grand Canyon, the miles of lush rainforests and country lanes. And when you tune into the radio, the jazz, country, hip-hop, rock and pop keep you company through this mish-mash of sights.</p>

    <img id="img4" src="4.jpg" alt="China">
    <p>Enigmatic and transparent at once, the country memorializes some and forgets others - beside fast-developed cities are crumbling villages, the time-worn Great Wall is unpolished against the vibrant hues of Buddhist temples, water towns some lively and some languid, gleaming metropolis a far cry from the desert-brushed fringes of the rural sprawl.</p>
    <p>When you've had your fill of modern malls and artifact-filled museums, spare time for China's magnificent landscapes. Choose between Yangshuo's winding rivers, Hong Kong's concrete jungle-scape, haunting Mongolia deserts, and the floral crown of Qinghai Lake.</p>
    <p>Or maybe you're better off picking at the historical intrigues within Beijing's Forbidden City, perhaps seeking out the hidden speakeasies of Shanghai. Regardless, if you come for the scenery you stay for the food; for China's culinary variations mean anything can be eaten and eaten with relish.</p>
